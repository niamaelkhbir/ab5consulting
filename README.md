# Ab5-Consulting
Ab5 Consulting project was the subject of my second year internship in my engineering school (master1).
Ab5 Consulting project was about creating a software that simulate a telecommunications network containing
several nodes such as satellites, earth stations... 
The product is be presented as Java software,extension.jar, and equipped with a graphical interface(GUI).
The algorithmic part of the project is done in language Java, since the latter allows a strong structuring of the code.
The scientific calculations part is done in language Python, since it provides libraries of calculations and
visualization of very rich and flexible data, all this in addition to being a fast language in in terms of calculation time.
The main window is based on Nasa WorldWind API. For more details about this API, see: https://github.com/NASAWorldWind
